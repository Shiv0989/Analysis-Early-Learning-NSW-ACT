## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the NSW & ACT Early Learning Data Analysis Project, an internship initiative at Uniting. This project focuses to utilize advanced data and spatial analysis to address key challenges in early childhood education in Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) in New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).

## Project Aim

The internship project aims to identify regions within NSW and ACT where the demand for early learning services exceeds the available supply and where service quality improvements are essential. The analyses are intended to guide Uniting's Early Learning Team in making strategic decisions for service expansion.

## Research Questions

This project focuses on answering vital questions to inform Uniting's strategy:

-> Which regions in NSW and ACT have a high early learning (EL) demand exceeding local capacity?

-> Where should Uniting consider opening new services in NSW and ACT?

-> What are the potential areas for new centres using Unitingâ€™s existing facilities and resources?

## Methodology

Our approach involves detailed statistical analysis and spatial techniques, utilizing open data sources like ABS SEIFA, AEDC data, ACECQA registers, and child population statistics. These analyses provide insights into child population density, developmental delays, quality ratings of existing early learning centres, and socio-economic status impacts.
